The following file includes various details of the project, including details of the theme used as well as workflow details.
The purpose of this document is to assist any new developers in continuing development of the site in the future.


Wordpress Theme Details

This wordpress theme is based off the underlines starter theme. 

We used the underlines theme as a base to begin creating our own custom theme, then looked at many other websites for inspiriation and design choices. WordPress is exceptional in this regard as there are many sources to gain knowledge from. 

We ultimately decided on a very minimalistic theme as we thought that would suit the target audience of older people. 

To begin with we styled the general content of the website starting with the header and main menu, then worked down from there. 

The main content of all pages has white space on the side to help make the content that is there readable and easy to scan. 

There is a mostly complete contact information section that was being worked on that with some tweaks will allow contact details to be displayed in the header. 


Publishing Details

Development of the site was done using three different stages, local development, a staging website and the final live website.

Each member had an individual local development environment and had access to both the staging and live website.
